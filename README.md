# Horiseon Code Refactor

Given the HTML and CSS for the Horiseon homepage, I was tasked with refactoring the code to fit accessibility standards.

## Changes to the Code

I focused most of my effort on consolidating the code. I was able to remove lines of redundant code by replacing the divs in the HTML with semantic elements. This allowed me to remove repetetive sections from the style sheet. The title was changed from "website" to "Horiseon," and alts were added to images in the content and bernefits sections (though they were placeholder alts, as the images are decorative) to aid in accesissibility. I added comments to the HTML and CSS to differentiate sections of the document from each other to make future adjustments easier.
